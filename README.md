# PROJECT: 0x1D. C BINARY TREES
- Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children (left & right)

- TASK 0: 
 create node

- Task 1:
 Insert left

- Task 2: 
 Insert right

- Task 3:
 Dlete an entire binary tree

- Task 4: 
 Check if node is leaf

- Task 5:
 Check if node is root

- Task 6: preorder traversal
> current node -> left subtree -> right subtree

- Task 7: inorder traversal
> left subtree -> cureent node -> right subtree

- Task 8: postorder traversal
> left subtree -> right subtree -> left subtree

- Task 9: Height of binary tree

- Task 10: depth

- Task 11: size of binary tree
> toltal number of nodes present in tree

- Task 12: Leaves
> count leaves in binary tree

- Task 13: count nodes with at least one child

- Task 14: check balance
> difference between heights of left and right subtrees

- Task 15: check if full
> check if every node in the tree have 0 or two children

- Task 16: checck if perfect
> formula (2^(h+1))-1 with h: height

- Task 17: find sebling

- Task 18: find uncle
