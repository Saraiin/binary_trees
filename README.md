# PROJECT: 0x1D. C BINARY TREES
- Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children (left & right)

- TASK 0: 
 create node

- Task 1:
 Insert left

- Task 2: 
 Insert right

- Task 3:
 Dlete an entire binary tree

- Task 4: 
 Check if node is leaf

- Task 5:
 Check if node is root

- Task 6: preorder traversal
> current node -> left subtree -> right subtree

- Task 7: inorder traversal
> left subtree -> cureent node -> right subtree

- Task 8: postorder traversal
> left subtree -> right subtree -> left subtree

- Task 9: Height of binary tree
